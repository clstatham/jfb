# "Just F-ing Build!"

`jfb` is a simple and opinionated build tool for C/C++ projects, inspired by Cargo.
It is intended mainly for personal use, but remains highly configurable in ways most useful to small, personal projects.

## Features

- Simple yet powerful configuration via a `jfb.toml` file.
- Can scaffold new projects by creating a default directory structure.
- Automates compiling and linking source files in a way that makes sense. CMake is da poop, no more!
